# ADR 001: Use React for Frontend Framework

## Date: 2026-02-14

## Status: Accepted

## Context
A frontend framework is needed for the Buckeye Marketplace e-commerce application. This will serve as the user interface for the users to interact with in the application. Users expect a modern, visually appealing, and easy-to-navigate application. The framework must support the creation of interactive user interfaces and enable rapid development. The frontend will also support product catalog browsing, user authentication, admin dashboard and other core features of the application.  As the team has limited experience with building applications, ease of learning and access to educational resources are important factors.

## Decision
React (with TypeScript) will be used as the frontend framework.

## Consequences
Positive: 
- Promotes code reusability and maintainability.
- Large ecosystem and strong community support.

Negative: 
- Performance can suffer if not optimized, especially in large applications.
- Frequent updates and changes in ecosystem may require ongoing maintenance and adaption.
